# A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable 
# and belongs to the global scope.

# Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.


# A variable created outside of a function is global and can be used by anyone:

x = 300

def myfunc():
  print(x)

myfunc()

print(x)
