# Python also has a convention 
# for protected properties using a single underscore _ prefix:


class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, salary):
    self.name = name
    self._salary = salary # Protected property

p1 = Person("Linus", 50000)

print(p1.name)
print(p1._salary) # Can access, but shouldn't


# A single underscore _ is just a convention. 
# It tells other programmers that the property is intended for internal use, 
# but Python doesn't enforce this restriction.
