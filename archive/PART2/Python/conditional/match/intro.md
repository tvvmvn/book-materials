# Match

The match statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.


syntax
```
match expression:
  case x:
    code block
  case y:
    code block
  case z:
    code block
```

This is how it works:

- The match expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.


```python
day = 4

match day:
  case 1:
    print("Monday")
  case 2:
    print("Tuesday")
  case 3:
    print("Wednesday")
  case 4:
    print("Thursday")
  case 5:
    print("Friday")
  case 6:
    print("Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Sunday")
```

## default

Use the underscore character _ as the last case value if you want a code block to execute when there are not other matches:

```python
day = 4
match day:
  case 6:
    print("Today is Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Today is Sunday")
  case _:
    print("Looking forward to the Weekend")
```
