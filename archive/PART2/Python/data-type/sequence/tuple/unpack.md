# Unpack

When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple:

```python
# Packing a tuple:
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# Unpacking a tuple:
(green, yellow, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)
```
