# Slicing


## positive indexing

You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, 
to return a part of the string.


```python
# Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
```


By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:

```python
# Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included):
b = "Hello, World!"

print(b[:5])
```


By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:

```python
# Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end:

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])
```


## Negative indexing

Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:

Get the characters:
From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)
To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):

```python
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])
```
